# AI Art Automation Pipeline

A robust Node.js bot that automates the creation, hosting, and delivery of AI-generated artwork. It leverages Bing Image Creator for generation, Cloudinary for persistent storage, and Discord Webhooks for real-time notifications.

## Features

* **Automated Generation:** Uses `bimg` to interface with Bing Image Creator.
* **Cloud Storage:** Automatically uploads base64 images to Cloudinary for permanent hosting.
* **Discord Integration:** Sends finished pieces directly to a specified Discord channel/thread.
* **Upscaling Capable:** Includes modules for upscaling via DeepAI or Replicate (configurable).
* **Error Handling:** Robust retry logic for failed generations or uploads.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tzohar/ai-image-pipeline.git
    cd ai-image-pipeline
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install

3.  **Configure Environment**
    Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:
    ```env
    BING_IMAGE_COOKIE=your_bing_cookie
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url
    ```
